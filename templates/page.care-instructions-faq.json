As all of our extensions are made from 100% human hair, they can be straightened, curled, blow-dried or styled in any way you like! Heres our top tips for safe styling…<br\/><br\/><strong>ALWAYS<\/strong> use a heat protection spray on the hair before using any heated tools such as tongs, straighteners, wavers, hair dryers or heated rollers.

Braids and soft rollers are perfect for creating heatless curls!<br\/><br\/><strong>AFTER<\/strong> washing your hair extensions its best to let them dry naturally if you have the time. You can do this by hanging them up in a warm area. Once the hair is dry you can then style as you wish feeling great that you’ve minimised the use of heat!<br\/><br\/><strong>180-190<\/strong> is the max temperature you should be using on hair extensions to avoid any damage or breakage.<br\/><br\/>If you need your extensions to dry quickly, apply heat protection spray and dry them with a hairdryer on a low heat.<\/p>",

This applies to all dyes and toners, including toning\/purple shampoos and pigmented conditioners<\/strong>. If you still decide to colour the hair, follow our advice below…<br\/><br\/><strong>NEVER<\/strong> bleach or lighten any hair extensions. If you need to dye the hair you should only go darker, never lighter as this will seriously damage the extensions.<br\/><br\/><strong>TEST<\/strong> a small section before dying the hair all over to check the colour is how you expect. Extensions are coated during manufacturing to prolong the lifespan; this can affect how colours take to the hair.<br\/><br\/>When using a toning shampoo on hair extensions it's best to do it as a colour bath to dilute the strength. Fill a sink with lukewarm water and add a few drops of the toning shampoo, mix well then soak the extensions for the recommended time.<br\/><br\/>Remember, we have over 60 colours to choose from in our collection and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cliphair.co.uk\/pages\/colour-matching-service\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Free colour matching\">free colour match service<\/a> to help you find the right shade, so chances are you won't need to dye the hair after all.<\/p>",
